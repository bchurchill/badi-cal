<h1>Unofficial FAQ on the 10 July 2014 Message and the Badi Calendar</h1>

<h2>The Letter</h2>

Please read the original letter <a href="http://universalhouseofjustice.bahai.org/activities-bahai-community/20140710_001">here</a>.  This is the best, authoritative source of information on the matter.

The Universal House of Justice has also distributed dates for the next
50 years (through Naw-Ruz 2064).

<h2>What changes were made?</h2>

Naw-Ruz is now celebrated the day of the spring equinox in Tehran; for
the near future, this is always March 20th or March 21st. This sets
the date for all the Feast nights and the seven Holy Days fixed to
the solar calendar. On years when Naw-Ruz is on the 21st, like 2015,
most of these days are the same as before, with the exception of the
Martyrdom of the Báb (now July 10) and the Declaration of the Báb
(now May 24), which are both one day later. On years when Naw-Ruz is
on the 20th, like 2016, all of these are one day earlier.

The Birth of the Báb and the Birth of Bahá'u'lláh are now
celebrated on a new moon in October and November. The dates will vary
each year.

The end of Ayyam-i-Ha and the start of the fast is fixed 19 days
before the following Naw-Ruz. This means that some years the fast will
being March 1st, and other years March 2nd. This makes the month of
fasting, the month of `Ala, different as its start date depends on the
succeeding Naw-Ruz rather than the preceeding one.

<h2>Why the change?</h2>

Since the times of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi
Effendi there have been details of the Badi calendar left unspecified.
Different locales developed ways to observe the calendar. For example,
in the West, we have fixed the Holy Days to the Gregorian calendar.
In the East, some of the Holy Days, such as the Twin Birthdays, were
celebrated on a lunar calendar.  Yet, the writings tell us 

In hindsight, this gradual evolution of the calendar appears
essential, as it would have been very difficult in past times for
Baha'is around the world to have a calendar that both starts on the
equinox and synchronized around the world. For example, if Baha'is
in the United States picked Naw-Ruz based on when the sun sets in
Pacific time, the dates would diverge from those picked by Baha'is
in the East. The way to remedy this is to pick one place on earth to
determine the equinox; and only now, with the Internet, that this
computation can both be done accurately in advance and distributed to
the Baha'i World.

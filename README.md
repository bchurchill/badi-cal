# badi-cal

Work in progress.
It kind of works already, there's just no user interface / website.
I've tested it on the JS console.
Unfortunately, this code needs:
- sunrise/sunset data
- equinox data
- moon phase data

and getting this all in JS means using 3rd party libraries that
are completely spaghetti code at times... making this all kind of
dangerous.
